### File Metadata Finder ###

User can select a folder/drive. Script will search all subdirectories and files, collecting filepath, date of creation/modification, and file size.

Script will write this information to a .csv file and save it to the same top-level directory as the search began in.

Useful for quickly collecting information throughout folder tree structure for analysis.
